# LendingClub-Loan-Visualization

The subject of our visualization is to examine the change in the characteristics of borrowers in the United States over the years in various aspects.
Our visualization theme focuses on the ‘Lending Club Loan’ dataset from Kaggle which contains data from LendingClub company. The data available on Kaggle is a comprehensive dataset of loan information from LendingClub from 2012 to 2016.

Through diverse and rich visualizations, we examine the characteristics of taking loans under different categories, such as: different job titles, different purposes for the loan, economic starting conditions (annual salary, owned properties) and more, and map them according to location in the world or filter by years.

The main question we would like to investigate is:

In what and how the characteristics of borrowers in the US change over the years?
